# provenance
A repo to sandbox approaches to creating provenance records and splice them into the metadata in other catalogues

The provenance model for (marine) biological samples and data that is being developed within the scope of EOSC Life and by EMBRC (VLIZ-Katrina Exter), is still a work in progress. See [the emo bon github repo](https://github.com/emo-bon/provenance-model-docs) for our working documentation, including: a UML diagram, a ttl example, an eml example, and the link to a googledoc where the model is explained (comments welcomed). 

We will post additional, MBO-specific files here, so we can create a way for prov information to be gathered already within MOB while the full model is being completed.
