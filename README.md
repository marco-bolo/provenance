# provenance
A repo to sandbox approaches to creating provenance records and splice them into the metadata in other catalogues or combine then with a more generic MBO dataset description 

I have taken the dataset description (json) from [oceaninfohub](https://book.oceaninfohub.org/thematics/dataset/index.html), one [work-in-progress json example from Pieter P](https://github.com/marco-bolo/dataset-catalogue/blob/main/datasets/biogoship/biogoship.json), and our [EMBRC provenance ttl file](https://github.com/marco-bolo/provenance-sandbox/blob/main/embrc_prov_example.ttl), and merged them into the [dataset-description-and-provenance file](https://github.com/marco-bolo/provenance-sandbox/blob/main/MergedDatasetDescriptionAndProvenance.json) provided in this repo. This was done to discuss it in our WP1 meetings, it is by no means an actual template to be followed yet; it is not even complete (a colleage is working on incorporating more of the provenance information therein). 

A technical description of our [EMBRC provenance ttl file](https://github.com/marco-bolo/provenance-sandbox/blob/main/embrc_prov_example.ttl) can be found in this repo [here](https://github.com/marco-bolo/provenance-sandbox/blob/main/EMBRC%20reference%20implementation%20for%20provenance_%20technical%20documentation.pdf) (version 0.1 -> i.e. not yet finalised)

I am creating a CSV file to gather the necessary metadata from data providers, with the aim that it allows for easy interaction and can be used no matter which final json file template we decide on. That is on https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tYAf9BJh_lDk4aI3-OX43FSKoPFbE-6882Nnj0peU7E/edit?usp=sharing.
